Bug 1: XSS Vulnerability

In the item-single.html there is the {director|safe} command in which the safe filter allows the website to run javascipt.
When we remove the safe filter, we prevent any modification to the html URL which prevents attackers to run malicious codefrom the URL.

Bug 2: CSRF 

In views.py there are lines of code which allow either POST or GET, we need to remove that part of the code to fix the CSRF bug.
